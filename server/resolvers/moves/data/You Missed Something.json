    "Name": "You Missed Something",
    "Description": "When you evaluate a friendly NPC's plan to get something done, roll with <strong>Focus</strong>. On a hit, the GM tells you how you can drastically improve the chances of success; get it done, and they're sure to come through on top. On a 7-9, the problems inherent in the plan are fairly serious; the NPC will be resistant to making the necessary changes. On a miss, something about the plan throws you for a loop; the GM tells you what obvious danger the NPC is ignoring...or what they're hiding about their intent.",
