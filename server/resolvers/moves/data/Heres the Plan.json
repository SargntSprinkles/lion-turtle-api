    "Name": "Here's the Plan",
    "Description": "When you commit to a plan you've proposed to the group, roll with <strong>Creativity</strong>; take a -1 for each of your companions who isn't on board. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. You can spend your hold 1-for-1 while the plan is being carried out to overcome or evade an obstacle, create an advantage, or neutralize a danger; if any of your companions abandon you while the plan is underway, you must mark a condition. On a miss, hold 1, but your plan goes awry when you encounter surpris- ing opposition.",
