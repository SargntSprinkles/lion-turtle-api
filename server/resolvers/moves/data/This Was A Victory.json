    "Description": "When you reveal that you have sabotaged a building, device, or vehicle right as it becomes relevant, mark fatigue and roll with <strong>Passion</strong>. On a hit, your work pays off, creating an opportunity for you and your allies at just the right time. On a 7-9, the opportunity is fleetingâ€”act fast to stay ahead of the consequences. On a miss, your action was ill-judged and something or someone you care about is hurt as collateral damage.",
