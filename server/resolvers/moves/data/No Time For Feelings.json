    "Description": "When you have equal or fewer conditions marked than your highest principle, mark fatigue to push down your feelings for the rest of the scene and ignore condition penalties until the end of the scene. When you <strong>resist an NPC shifting your balance</strong>, mark a condition to roll with conditions marked (max +4). You cannot then choose to clear a condition by immediately proving them wrong.",
