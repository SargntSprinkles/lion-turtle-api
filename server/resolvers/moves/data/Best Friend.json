    "Name": "Best Friend",
    "Description": "Your best friend is small, fuzzy, and depend- able. Unlike all your other relationships, this one is simple and true. You can understand and communicate with your small companion and--although they may give you a hard time now and again--they are always there when you need them most. Whenever your pal could help you push your luck, mark fatigue to roll with <strong>Creativity</strong> instead of <strong>Passion</strong>. If your pet ever gets hurt, mark a condition.",
