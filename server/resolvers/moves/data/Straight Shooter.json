    "Description": "When you tell an NPC the blunt, honest truth about what you really think of them and their plans, roll with <strong>Focus</strong>. On a hit, they'll look upon your honesty favorably; they'll answer a non-compromising question honestly and grant you a simple favor. On a 7-9, they also give you an honest assessment of how they see you; mark a condition. On a miss, you're a bit too honestâ€”they're either furious or genuinely hurt.",
