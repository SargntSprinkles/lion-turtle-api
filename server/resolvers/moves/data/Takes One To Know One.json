    "Description": "When you verbally needle someone by finding the weaknesses in their armor, roll with <strong>Focus</strong>. On a hit, ask 1 question. On a 7-9, they ask 1 of you as well:<ul><li>What is your principle?</li><li>What do you need to prove?</li><li>What could shake your certainty?</li><li>Whom do you care about more than you let on?</li></ul>Anyone who lies or stonewalls marks 2-fatigue. On a miss, your attack leaves you exposed; they may ask you any one question from the list, and you must answer honestly.",
